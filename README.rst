Running tests
-------------

To run pytest in currently installed environment:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run pytest

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

Development dependencies for ``tracerepo`` include:

-  ``poetry``

   -  Used to handle Python package dependencies.

   .. code:: bash

      # Use poetry run to execute poetry installed cli tools such as invoke,
      # nox and pytest
      poetry run

-  ``pytest``

   -  ``pytest`` is a Python test runner. It is used to run defined tests to
      check that the package executes as expected. The defined tests in
      ``./tests`` contain many regression tests (done with
      ``pytest-regressions``) that make it almost impossible
      to add features to ``tracerepo`` that changes the results of functions
      and methods.

-  ``coverage``

   -  To check coverage of tests

-  ``sphinx``

   -  Creates documentation from files in ``./docs_src``.

Big thanks to all maintainers of the above packages!
